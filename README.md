- 👋 Hi, I’m Aref
- 👀 I’m interested in all things programming - I currently focus on looking at game and web design and love creative stuff too.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, Ruby and how to manipulate the Linux CLI in University. Outside of that, I am trying to learn various game engines and languages.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any games or programming projects that anyone has! Just shoot me a brief or DM and if I'm interested, I can try and make some time :)
- 📫 How to reach me - Discord is most likely best, @valikaze.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
